# Predicting-Contract-Disputes
Explanation:

Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of contract disputes based on the textual content of contracts. The project involves the following steps:

Data Preparation: Created a sample dataset with contract texts and their corresponding dispute labels.

Text Vectorization: Utilized TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert contract text into numerical features.

Model Training: Trained a Logistic Regression model on the vectorized contract text.

Prediction and Evaluation: Predicted disputes on the test set and evaluated the model's performance using classification metrics.

New Predictions: Predicted the likelihood of disputes for new contract texts.

Key Features:
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Applied TF-IDF vectorization to process and analyze contract text.

Machine Learning: Used Logistic Regression to classify contracts as likely to result in disputes or not.

Evaluation Metrics: Assessed the model's performance using classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
